Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust testing environment to ensure that a Large Language Model (LLM) operates in a ‘safe mode,’ effectively moderating responses to prevent exposure to harmful content for children. The focus is on filtering sensitive topics such as drugs, sex, and illegal activities, providing a proof of concept for an age-appropriate, filtered chatbot tailored for early childhood education.

Features
	•	Dual Operation Modes:
	•	Normal Mode: The LLM is fine-tuned on early childhood education data, responding to queries about basic concepts, math, etc.
	•	Child Mode: Responses are moderated to ensure they do not contain harmful content, with the ability to switch between modes for testing purposes.
	•	Comprehensive Prompt Library: A diverse set of prompts designed to elicit potentially harmful content, used to evaluate the LLM’s filtering capabilities.
	•	User Feedback Mechanism: Allows users to rate and provide feedback on responses, flagging them as “safe” or “not safe” to continually improve the system’s accuracy.

Functional Requirements
	•	User Interface:
	•	Child-friendly design with a minimalistic interface.
	•	Easy toggling between Normal and Child modes.
	•	Feedback submission feature for users to flag responses.
	•	Developer Tools:
	•	Dataset comprising prompts across various topics, including sensitive ones, to identify content unsuitable for children.
	•	Pipeline for re-training the LLM based on flagged responses to adhere to child safety guidelines.
	•	Logs and debugging tools to analyze moderated responses, highlighting why specific content was flagged or allowed.
	•	Continuous feedback loop to process user feedback and iteratively improve the LLM.

Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance and Scalability: The system must handle increasing data sizes and computation demands without sacrificing performance. Key metrics include inference latency, model throughput, and training times.
	•	Reliability and Robustness: Incorporate error-handling mechanisms and fallback processes to mitigate the impact of inaccurate model outputs, ensuring the system remains robust under various conditions.
	•	Data Privacy and Security: Ensure the privacy and security of sensitive user data through strong encryption, data anonymization, and compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR. Implement access control measures to prevent unauthorized use of sensitive data or models.
	•	Ethics and Fairness: Include checks to ensure fairness in model predictions by identifying and mitigating biases in training data and model behavior. Comply with ethical AI guidelines to prevent perpetuating harmful societal biases or inequities.

Future Implementations

Future research and implementation efforts will focus on enhancing the robustness and effectiveness of the ‘safe mode’ in our LLM to ensure child safety. Key areas include:
	•	Advanced Red-Teaming Techniques: Developing sophisticated methods to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the LLM’s filtering mechanisms.
	•	Multimodal Content Moderation: Expanding the LLM’s capabilities to moderate various content forms, such as text, images, and videos, providing a holistic safe environment for children.
	•	Personalized Safety Filters: Implementing adaptive filtering systems that consider individual user profiles, including age and sensitivity levels, to tailor content moderation appropriately.
	•	Ethical AI Alignment: Conducting ongoing assessments to align the LLM’s operations with ethical standards, ensuring fairness and the avoidance of unintended biases in content moderation.
	•	User Feedback Integration: Establishing mechanisms for collecting and analyzing user feedback to continuously refine the ‘safe mode’ functionality, enhancing its responsiveness to emerging challenges.

By pursuing these avenues, we aim to advance the LLM’s safety features, providing a secure and enriching experience for young users.
